# Gamba Orbital System - Project Brief

## Overview
Building a complete orbital creation architecture using probabilistic mechanics on the Alkanes blockchain protocol. The system implements factory patterns that create collectible wand tokens through XOR-based randomness enhanced by DUST token consumption.

## Core Objective
Demonstrate and prove that:
1. **The factory creates immutable orbital tokens** (one-time probabilistic creation)
2. **DUST consumption enhances probability** (economic enhancement model)  
3. **Complete forge history is preserved** (provable rarity and authenticity)

## Key Innovation
Successfully adapted boiler's proven Factory â†’ Token security patterns for orbital mechanics, implementing deterministic randomness through blockchain data XOR calculations with DUST-based probability enhancement.

## Technical Foundation
- **Blockchain**: Alkanes protocol with WebAssembly smart contracts
- **Architecture**: Wand factory + Orbital wand tokens + DUST enhancement system
- **Language**: Rust with alkanes-runtime framework
- **Randomness**: XOR of transaction ID and merkle root with DUST bonuses

## Orbital vs Vault Mechanics

### Boiler (Vault Model)
- **Continuous**: Deposit/withdraw over time
- **Mutable**: Position state changes with rewards
- **Time-Based**: MasterChef-style reward accrual
- **Reversible**: Users can exit positions

### Gamba (Orbital Model)  
- **One-Time**: Single creation event per token
- **Immutable**: Permanent forge history storage
- **Probability-Based**: Success determined by randomness threshold
- **Irreversible**: Created orbitals exist permanently

## Success Criteria
âœ… **ACHIEVED**: Complete architectural analysis from boiler reference
âœ… **IN PROGRESS**: Factory â†’ Token pattern adaptation for orbital mechanics
ðŸŽ¯ **TARGET**: Deterministic randomness with DUST enhancement implementation
ðŸŽ¯ **TARGET**: Comprehensive test suite demonstrating all orbital mechanics
ðŸŽ¯ **TARGET**: Trace log validation of every creation event

## Economic Model

### DUST Consumption Mechanics
- **Always Consumed**: Regardless of success/failure (economic sink)
- **Linear Enhancement**: +5 probability per 1000 DUST consumed
- **Capped Bonus**: Maximum +255 (guaranteed success at 51,000 DUST)
- **Base Success**: 56.25% without enhancement (144/255 threshold)

### Rarity Distribution
- **Legendary**: 253-255 result (~1.2% of successes)
- **Epic**: 245-252 result (~3.1% of successes)
- **Rare**: 230-244 result (~5.9% of successes)  
- **Uncommon**: 200-229 result (~11.8% of successes)
- **Common**: 145-199 result (~78.0% of successes)

## Project Significance
This represents a novel adaptation of proven DeFi vault patterns for collectible token creation, solving the challenge of fair randomness generation while maintaining economic sustainability through controlled probability enhancement mechanics.
